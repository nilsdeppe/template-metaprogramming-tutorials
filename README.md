# Template Metaprogramming Tutorials Examples
Here I am sharing the code used in my series of [blog posts](http://nilsdeppe.com) on template metaprogramming. In the files are my solutions to some of the exercises presented in the posts. Note that some of the later posts rely on a template metaprogramming library like [brigand](https://github.com/edouarda/brigand). The files require a C++11 compliant compiler to compile.
